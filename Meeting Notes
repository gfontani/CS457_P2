Awget.h   ----------------------------------awget.cpp
-struct for chain     -                     -read chainFile
-struct/for file?       -                     -put into list of some sort.
-send/recieve             -                  -argument checking
-recieve file                - 
                                - SS.cpp
                                 -wget filed
                                 -usage

Some questions:  Are we handling giving a port number to stepping stone?
                 I think we need to be putting a comma between ip address and port?
                 Do we need to error check ip address and port numbers?


Things to do:
make sure to call check address when reading the ip file to make sure you have valid IP's.
(what to do if we find a bad one?  cnx?  exit?  go to next one?).
Gabby is going to write all of the code starting with send and recieve.
Where do our stucts need to go?  Is it ok if we took the struct out of awget.
