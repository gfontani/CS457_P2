-struct for chain     -                     -read chainFile
-struct/for file?       -                     -put into list of some sort.

Things to do:
make sure to call check address when reading the ip file to make sure you have valid IP's.
(what to do if we find a bad one?  cnx?  exit?  go to next one?).
Gabby is going to write all of the code starting with send and recieve.
