# CS457_P2
Project 2 for CS457 Networking
to run the program:
1. run command a make to make all executables.
2. run command ./ss with our without -p flag to set port
3. run command ./ss on multiple computers
4. run command ./awget <url> optional -c flag to include non standard chainfile  from a seperate directory from where ss is running

In the printing output for SS we assumed the next SS would still be in the chainlist so the next SS in the path is included in the print out of the chainlist.

The multi threading will delete the file if awget and ss are run on the same maching and from the same dirrectory.  Please run SS and awget from different directories, if you are using the same login.  

We chose to spell Goodbye correctly dispite it not matching the example perfectly.

sincerly, 
   Team Awesome Sauce
